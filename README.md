# Supply Chain Disruption Triage — OpenEnv

> **An agent environment for real-world supply chain crisis management.**
> Agents triage live disruption signals and re-allocate purchase orders across alternate
> vendors to minimize stockouts, cost overruns, and delivery delays.

## Why This Problem?

Supply chain disruptions cost the global economy **$4 trillion+ annually** (McKinsey, 2023).
When a supplier fails, a port closes, or a commodity price spikes, procurement teams
manually scramble across spreadsheets and email chains to re-route hundreds of orders.
This process is slow (hours to days), error-prone, and requires deep domain expertise.

No off-the-shelf AI tool reliably solves this. It demands:
- Multi-objective optimization (cost vs. speed vs. stockout risk vs. budget)
- Constraint satisfaction (capacity limits, SKU availability, lead time windows)
- Cascading impact reasoning (one disruption ripples through multiple orders)
- Prioritization under uncertainty (urgent orders first, partial coverage is better than none)

This environment models exactly that workflow, with deterministic graders that reward
partial progress — making it suitable for both RL training and LLM evaluation.

## 🖥️ Live Operations Dashboard (For Non-Technical Users)

We have built a beautiful, fully interactive **Operations Dashboard** so that anyone—regardless of technical background—can visually explore and interact with the Supply Chain Environment. You don't need to write code to experience how the AI agent triages crises!

### How to open the Dashboard:
1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the dashboard folder:
   ```bash
   cd supply-chain-ui
   ```
3. Install the required files and start the dashboard by typing:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open your web browser and click the link provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`). 

**What you can do in the Dashboard:**
* **Run a Simulation:** Click **"Local Demo"** to see the system simulate supply chain crises without needing to set up the Python backend.
* **Visualize Disruption:** Watch as global port closures or factory bankruptcies appear securely at the top of your screen.
* **Make Decisions:** Try interacting with the "At Risk" orders and click on available vendors to see how an AI agent drafts rerouting commands!

## Environment Description

The agent operates a procurement desk. At each step it receives an **Observation**
describing the current supply chain state and must issue an **Action** (re-allocations,
cancellations, or order splits) to minimize a multi-objective cost function.

### Observation Space

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `disruptions` | `List[DisruptionEvent]` | Active events (failures, delays, price spikes, shortages) |
| `pending_orders` | `List[PurchaseOrder]` | Orders and their current allocation status |
| `suppliers` | `List[Supplier]` | All suppliers with capacity, cost, lead time, and disruption flag |
| `inventory` | `List[InventoryLevel]` | Current stock per SKU vs. safety stock threshold |
| `demand_forecast` | `Dict[str, List[int]]` | 14-day daily demand forecast per SKU |
| `budget_remaining` | `float` | Remaining procurement budget (USD) |
| `stockout_risk_skus` | `List[str]` | SKUs currently at risk of stockout |
| `step` | `int` | Current episode step |
| `task_description` | `str` | Natural language task objective |

### Action Space

```json
{
  "reallocations": [
    {
      "order_id": "PO-0001",
      "new_supplier_id": "SUP-04",
      "quantity": 250,
      "priority": "urgent"
    }
  ],
  "cancel_orders": ["PO-0007"],
  "split_orders": [
    {
      "order_id": "PO-0003",
      "splits": [
        {"order_id": "PO-0003", "new_supplier_id": "SUP-02", "quantity": 150, "priority": "normal"},
        {"order_id": "PO-0003", "new_supplier_id": "SUP-09", "quantity": 150, "priority": "normal"}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Rerouted urgent chip orders to Dallas supplier; split large motor order."
}
```

### Reward Function

Reward is a **multi-objective weighted score** in `[0.0, 1.0]` computed at every step:

| Component | Weight | Measures |
|---|---|---|
| Stockout avoidance | **40%** | Fraction of at-risk orders resolved; bonus for urgent-first |
| Cost efficiency | **30%** | Cost vs. baseline; penalizes >10% premium harshly |
| Lead time compliance | **20%** | Allocated supplier lead time ≤ required-by day |
| Budget adherence | **10%** | Remaining budget ratio; hard penalty for overspend |

Penalties (subtracted from total) are applied for: allocating to disrupted suppliers,
unknown order/supplier IDs, SKU mismatches, and split quantity errors.

## Tasks

### Task 1 — Single Supplier Failure *(easy)*
**ID:** `task_single_supplier_failure`

A factory fire has taken `SUP-01` (Apex Components, Shenzhen) offline. 3 of 8 orders
are now at risk. Re-route them to alternate suppliers within a $50,000 budget.

- Max steps: 5
- Passing grade: ≥ 0.60
- Key challenge: Find a supplier that carries the affected SKUs at acceptable cost

### Task 2 — Port Congestion Cascade *(medium)*
**ID:** `task_port_congestion_cascade`

Shanghai port congestion causes +9 day delays across all CN/TW shipments. Additionally,
PacificParts (SUP-03) is short on chip components (+15% cost, +5 day delay). 12 of 18
orders are impacted. Split large orders, prioritize urgent ones, stay within $120,000.

- Max steps: 8
- Passing grade: ≥ 0.55
- Key challenge: Optimal use of order splitting + urgency-weighted triage

### Task 3 — Multi-Shock Supply Crisis *(hard)*
**ID:** `task_multi_shock_crisis`

Simultaneous events:
- `SUP-06` (Atlas Industrial) files for **bankruptcy** — all orders void
- Rotterdam port **closed** (strike) — +12 day delay on NL shipments
- Global **chip + battery shortage** — +35% price spike, 60% allocation cap reduction
- 20+ orders affected, hard budget ($200k) and lead time (≤14 days) constraints

- Max steps: 12
- Passing grade: ≥ 0.45
- Key challenge: Multi-constraint optimization under severe resource scarcity

## Baseline Scores

Run against `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct` via HuggingFace Router:

| Task | Difficulty | Avg Reward | Final Step Reward |
|---|---|---|---|
| task_single_supplier_failure | Easy | ~0.55 | ~0.65 |
